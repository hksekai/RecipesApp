## Brainstorming

Prompt
```
I am working on a class project for my masters program. The project will be to build a web application with a functional front end, backend, data base, and some messaging queues. I am brainstorming some ideas for a project. My current thought process is a simple application that can take in a a list of raw ingredients that I may have around and have it generate recipes. Part of the class requirement would be to utilize an external API. I'm thinking that I can utilize any existing recipe repository APIs. If none is known to exist or is not publicly available, my fallback may be to utilize openrouter to converse with an API to come up wit the recipe
